# BuildAI Pro: Intelligent Construction Planning System

[cite_start]BuildAI Pro is a project planning assistant that combines advanced calculation algorithms with the **IBM Granite 3.3 2B** AI model to provide instant, data-driven construction insights[cite: 8, 736].

## 🚀 Features
* [cite_start]**Material Estimation:** Instant calculations for Steel, Cement, Sand, and Water based on area and floors[cite: 25, 95].
* [cite_start]**AI Strategy:** Personalized construction tips generated locally by **IBM Granite 3.3 2B**[cite: 10, 538].
* [cite_start]**Privacy-First:** Powered by **Ollama**, ensuring all data stays local with no cloud API keys required[cite: 11, 737].
* [cite_start]**Phase-by-Phase Schedule:** A complete week-by-week timeline from site prep to final handover [cite: 39-44, 669-705].

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
* [cite_start]**Backend:** Flask (Python) [cite: 53]
* [cite_start]**AI Model:** IBM Granite 3.3 2B (Local via Ollama) [cite: 53, 60]
* [cite_start]**Frontend:** Responsive HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript [cite: 55, 106]
